CrocoDS
=======

Amstrad emulator for Nintendo DS.

Based on Win-CPC by Ludovic Deplanque.

First version of CrocoDS was created for... Nintendo DS. 

Why another Amstrad emulator ?
==============================

CrocoDS is made to give the best playing experience to all users ! 
A lof of demo will not run on CrocoDS. We don't care. 

All we want is to give you a lot of fun ! 

Amstrad have a lot of great games (my preferences for Boulderdash, Bomb Jack, ...).
